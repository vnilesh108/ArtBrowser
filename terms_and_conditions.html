         from delivery, the Products shall be free from material defects.
         However, this warranty does not apply in the circumstances described in
         clause 14.2.</span><br/>
         <span>
         14.2&nbsp;The
         warranty in clause 14.1 does not apply to any defect in the Products
         arising from: a) fair wear and tear; b) wilful damage, abnormal storage
         or working conditions, accident, negligence by you or by any third
         party; c) if you fail to operate or use the Products in accordance with
         its intention; d) any alteration or repair by you or by a third party
         who is not one of our authorised repairers; or e) any specification
         provided by you.</span><br/>
         <span>
         14.3&nbsp;If
         you are a consumer, this warranty is in addition to your legal rights
         in relation to Products that are faulty or not as described. Advice
         about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice
         Bureau or Trading Standards office.</span><br/>
         <h5>15. OUR LIABILITY IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS</h5>
         <span>This clause 15 only applies if you are a business customer.</span><br/>
         <span>
         15.1&nbsp;Nothing
         in these Terms limit or exclude our liability for: a) death or personal
         injury caused by our negligence; b) fraud or fraudulent
         misrepresentation; or c) defective products under the Consumer
         Protection Act 1987.</span><br/>
         <span>
         15.2&nbsp;Subject
         to clause 15.1, we will under no circumstances whatever be liable to
         you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of
         statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in connection with the
         Contract for: a) any loss of profits, sales, business, or revenue; b)
         loss or corruption of data, information or software; c) loss of business
         opportunity; d) loss of anticipated savings; e) loss of goodwill; or f)
         any indirect or consequential loss.</span><br/>
         <span>
         15.3&nbsp;Except
         as expressly stated in these Terms, we do not give any representation,
         warranties or undertakings in relation to the Products. Any
         representation, condition or warranty which might be implied or
         incorporated into these Terms by statute, common law or otherwise is
         excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. In particular, we will
         not be responsible for ensuring that the Products are suitable for your
         purposes.</span>
         </p>
         <h5>16. OUR LIABILITY IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER</h5>
         <span>
         This clause 16 only applies if you are a consumer.</span><br/>
         <span>
         16.1&nbsp;If
         we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or
         damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these
         Terms or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any loss or
         damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if they
         were an obvious consequence of our breach or if they were contemplated
         by you and us at the time we entered into the Contract.</span><br>
         <span>16.2&nbsp;We
         only supply the Products for domestic and private use. You agree not to
         use the product for any commercial, business or re-sale purposes, and
         we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business,
         business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</span><br>
         <span>16.3&nbsp;We
         do not in any way exclude or limit our liability for: a) death or
         personal injury caused by our negligence; b) fraud or fraudulent

         (description, satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and samples);
         and e) defective products under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.</span><br>
         </p>
         <h5>17. EVENTS OUTSIDE CONTROL</h5>
         <span>
         17.1&nbsp;We
         or the Supplier will not be liable or responsible for any failure to
         perform, or delay in performance of, any of obligations under a Contract
         that is caused by an Event Outside Control. An Event Outside Control is
         defined below in clause 17.2.</span><br>
         <span>
         17.2&nbsp;An&nbsp;Event
         Outside Control&nbsp;means any act or event beyond reasonable control,
         including without limitation strikes, lock-outs or other industrial
         action by third parties, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist
         attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or
         threat or preparation for war, fire, explosion, storm, flood,
         earthquake, subsidence, epidemic or other natural disaster, or failure
         of public or private telecommunications networks or impossibility of the
         use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport or other means of
         public or private transport.</span><br>
         <span>
         17.3&nbsp;If
         an Event Outside Control takes place that affects the performance of
         the obligations: a) you will be contacted as soon as reasonably
         possible; and b) the obligations will be suspended and the time for
         performance will be extended for the duration of the Event Outside
         Control. Where the Event Outside Control affects delivery of Products to
         you, a new delivery date will be arranged with you after the Event
         Outside Control is over.</span>

         18. COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN US</h5>
         <span>
         18.1&nbsp;When we refer, in these Terms, to "in writing", this will include e-mail.</span><br>
         <span>
         18.2&nbsp;If
         you wish to contact us in writing, or if any clause in these Terms
         requires you to give us notice in writing, you can send this to us by
         e-mail:&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="mailto:help@artbrowserapp.com" target="_self"
            data-content="help@artbrowserapp.com" data-type="mail">help@artbrowserapp.com</a></span>.
         We will confirm receipt of this by contacting you in writing, normally by e-mail.</span><br>
         <span>
         18.3&nbsp;If
         we have to contact you or give you notice in writing, we will do so by
         e- mail or by pre-paid post to the address you provide to us in your
         order.</span><br>
         <span>
         18.4&nbsp;If
         you are a business, please note that any notice given by you to us, or
         by us to you, will be deemed received and properly served immediately
         when posted on our website, 24&nbsp;hours after an e-mail is sent, or
         three&nbsp;days after the date of posting of any letter. In proving the
         service of any notice, it will be sufficient to prove, in the case of a
         letter, that such letter was properly addressed, stamped and placed in
         the post and, in the case of an e-mail, that such e-mail was sent to the
         specified e-mail address of the addressee.</span>
         </p>
         <h5>19. OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS</h5>
         <span>
         19.1&nbsp;We
         may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to another
         organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations
         under these Terms.</span><br>
         <span>
         19.2&nbsp;You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under
         these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.</span><br>
         <span>
         19.3&nbsp;This
         contract is between you and us or between you and the Supplier. No
         other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms, whether
         under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties Act) 1999 or otherwise.</span><br>
         <span>
         19.4&nbsp;Each
         of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or
         relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or
         unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and
         effect.</span><br>
         <span>
         19.5&nbsp;If
         we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these
         Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in
         doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you
         and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those
         obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in
         writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any
         later default by you.</span><br>
         <span>
         19.6&nbsp;If
         you are a consumer, please note that these Terms are governed by
         English law. This means a Contract for the purchase of Products through
         our site and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with
         it will be governed by English law. You and we and the Supplier agree to
         that the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive
         jurisdiction. However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may
         also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of
         Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.</span><br>
         <span>
         19.7&nbsp;If
         you are a business, these Terms are governed by English law. This means
         that a Contract, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
         connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including
         non-contractual disputes or claims), will be governed by English law.
         We, you and the Supplier agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
         courts of England and Wales.</span>
         </p>
         <h2>PART B</h2>
         <span>
         This
         Part B to the Terms only applies to purchases that you make from
         Suppliers. Part B is supplementary to and should be read together with
         Part A (except clauses 7, 9-14) of the Terms. In the event of any
         inconsistency between this Part B and Part A, this Part B will prevail.</span><br>
         <h5>20. ROLE OF THE SUPPLIER AND US</h5>
         <span>
         20.1&nbsp;You are purchasing the Products from the Supplier so the Contract is between the Supplier and you only.</span><br>
         <span>
         20.2&nbsp;We
         are neither the buyer nor the seller of the Supplier's Products even
         though we will receive your payment on behalf of the Supplier. As such,
         any contractual obligations arising out of your purchase of the
         Supplier’s Products are the responsibility of the Supplier and you.</span><br>
         <span>
         20.3&nbsp;We
         have no responsibility to you in relation to your order from a Supplier
         or any Supplier Products, except as expressly set out in these terms</span>
         </p>
         <h5>21. PRICES AND DELIVERY CHARGES</h5>
         <span>
         21.1&nbsp;The
         prices of the Products will be as quoted on our site from time to time.
         We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Products are
         correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the
         system. However if we discover an error in the price of Product(s) you
         ordered, please see clause 2.5 in this Part B for what happens in this
         event.</span><br>
         <span>
         21.2&nbsp;Prices for the Products may change from time to time, but
         changes will not affect any order already confirmed.</span><br>
         <span>
         21.3&nbsp;The
         price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable
         current rate chargeable in the UK for the time being. However, if the
         rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of
         delivery, the VAT you pay will be adjusted, unless you have already paid
         for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.</span><br>
         <span>
         21.4&nbsp;The
         price of a Product does not include delivery charges. Delivery charges
         are as quoted on our site from time to time. To check relevant delivery
         charges, please refer to the Delivery Charges section in our&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a

         <span>
         21.5&nbsp;Our
         site contains a large number of Products. It is always possible that,
         despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Products on our site may be
         incorrectly priced. If we discover an error in the price of the Products
         you have ordered we will inform you of this error and we will give you
         the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or
         cancelling your order. We will not process your order with the Supplier
         until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using
         the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat
         the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. Please note that if
         the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably
         been recognised by you as a mispricing, the Supplier do not have to
         provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price.</span><br>
         <span>
         21.6&nbsp;All
         Products shown on our site are subject to availability. We will inform
         you by e-mail as soon as possible if the Supplier is unable to fulfil
         your order.</span>
         </p>
         <h5> 22. HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND THE SUPPLIER</h5>
         <span>
         22.1&nbsp;For questions regarding placing an order on our site, please see our&nbsp;<span
            style="text-decoration:underline;"><a

         <span><br/>
         22.2&nbsp;The
         order process allows you to check and amend any errors before
         submitting your order to Supplier. Please take the time to read and
         check your order at each page of the order process.</span><br>
         <span><br/>
         22.3&nbsp;After
         you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging
         that we have received your order on behalf of the Supplier. However,
         please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted by
         the Supplier or by us. The Supplier’s acceptance of your order will
         take place as described in clause 7.4 in this Part A.</span><br/>
         <span>
         22.4&nbsp;We
         will on behalf of the Supplier confirm the Supplier’s acceptance to you
         by sending you an e-mail that confirms that the Products have been
         dispatched&nbsp;(Order Confirmation). The Contract between the Supplier
         and you will only be formed when we send you the Order Confirmation.</span><br/>
         <span>
         22.5&nbsp;If
         the Supplier is unable to supply you with a Product, for example
         because that Product is not in stock or no longer available or because
         of an error in the price on our site as referred to in clause 2.1 in
         this Part B, you will be informed of this by e-mail and your order will
         not be processed. If you have already paid for the Products, the full
         amount will be returned to you as soon as possible.</span>
         </p>
         <h5>23. DELIVERY</h5>
         <span>
         23.1&nbsp;Your
         order will be fulfilled as soon as reasonable, unless there is an Event
         Outside Control, and we will provide you with a tracking number once
         the Products have been shipped. If we are unable to fulfil delivery
         because of an Event Outside Control, we will contact you.</span><br>
         <span><br/>
         23.2&nbsp;Delivery will be completed when the Products are delivered to the address you gave when making the order.</span></br>
         <span>
         23.3&nbsp;The Products will be your responsibility from the completion of delivery.</span></br>
         <span>
         23.4&nbsp;You own the Products once you have made the payment in full, including all applicable delivery charges.</span></br>
         <span>
         23.5&nbsp;Please
         note that where you purchase Products from a Supplier and Products from
         us in the same order the Supplier is responsible for delivery of the
         Products it has sold and we are responsible for the delivery of the
         Products we have sold. Therefore, delivery will be made separately and
         will not necessarily arrive at the same time. Note you may also be
         charged separate shipping costs.</span>

         <h5> 24. INTERNATIONAL DELIVERY</h5>
         <span>
         <span>
         24.1&nbsp;International
         shipping destinations are set by the seller. We do our best to
         encourage sellers to ship worldwide, but in some cases, sellers will
         only ship to a limited set of countries.</span><span>
         If you wish to have a Product delivered to a country that a seller currently does not ship to, please contact:&nbsp;</span>

         <span>(International Delivery Destinations). However, there are restrictions
         on some Products for certain International Delivery Destinations, so
         please review the information on that page carefully before ordering
         Products.</span></span></br>
         <span>
         24.2&nbsp;If
         you order Products from our site for delivery to one of the
         International Delivery Destinations, your order may be subject to import
         duties and taxes which are applied when the delivery reaches that
         destination. Please note that neither we nor the Supplier have no
         control over these charges and cannot predict their amount.</span>
         <span><br>
         24.3&nbsp;You
         will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes.
         Please contact your local customs office for further information before
         placing your order.</span>
         <br><br>
         <span>
         24.4&nbsp;You
         must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for
         which the Products are destined. We or the Supplier will not be liable
         or responsible if you break any such law.</span>

         <h5>25. YOUR CANCELLATION AND REFUND RIGHTS IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER</h5>
         <span>
         This clause 25 only applies if you are a consumer.</span></br>
         <span>
         25.1&nbsp;If
         you are a consumer, you have a legal right to cancel your Contract with
         the Supplier under&nbsp;The Consumer Contracts (Information,
         Cancellation and Additional Payments) Regulations 2013&nbsp;during the
         period set out below in clause 9.3 in this Part B. This means that
         during the relevant period if you change your mind or for any other
         reason you decide you do not want to keep a Product, you can notify us
         of your decision to cancel the Contract with the Supplier and receive a
         refund.</span><br/>
         <span>
         25.2&nbsp;However, this cancellation right does not apply in the case of any made-to-measure or custom-made products</span><br/>
         <span>
         25.3&nbsp;You
         may cancel a Contract from the date you receive the Order Confirmation,
         which is when the Contract between you and the Supplier is formed. If
         the Products have already been delivered to you, you have a period of 14
         (fourteen) days in which you may cancel, starting from the day you
         receive the Products.</span><br/>
         <span>
         25.4&nbsp;To cancel a Contract, you must contact us in writing by sending an e-mail to:&nbsp;<span

            data-content="help@artbrowserapp.com" data-type="mail">help@artbrowserapp.com</a></span>.
         You may wish to keep a copy of your cancellation notification for your
         own records. A member of the ArtBrowser Customer Services team will then
         contact you regarding how to return the Products.</span><br>
         <span>
         25.5&nbsp;If
         you are entitled to a refund, we will refund you on the credit card or
         debit card used by you to pay. You will receive a full refund of the
         price you paid for the Products and any applicable delivery charges you
         paid.</span><br>
         <span>

               adjust the price of the artwork on ArtBrowser, before or after Sale of

            is entitled to take Commission on any sale of your Artwork or Artworks
            to any Customer first introduced to your Artworks, or with whom you have

            complete sales or any other monetary transactions initiated on the

            In

            <span>
            Your

               3. CONSENT AND STORAGE
            </h5>
            <span>
            3.1&nbsp;By
            providing any information to AB through the Site and by using the Site
            as a registered user, you are consenting to the collection, storage and
            use of your personal information by AB as set out in this Privacy Policy
            and the Terms of Use. You understand and grant consent to the
            collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information
            outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). If you do not consent to the
            collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information to
            other countries and territories outside the EEA, then you must not use
            the Site as a registered user and you accept that many features may
            therefore be unavailable to you.</span><span>
            3.2&nbsp;When
            you provide AB with personally identifiable information (information
            from which you can be identified), it may be used by AB and its direct
            and indirect consolidated subsidiaries or parents for the purposes of,
            for example, providing you with services and sending you correspondence,
            and additionally may be transferred to entities other than AB’s
            affiliates. These entities may be located in countries outside the EEA.
            Each of these countries has different privacy laws that provide
            different levels of protection for your personally identifiable
            information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive as those that
            exist in the EEA. By registering with AB, you consent to AB and their
            direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries’ or parents’ transmission
            to, and processing of your information in any jurisdiction in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy.</span><span>
            3.3&nbsp;The
            data that we collect from you may be stored at a destination outside
            the EEA. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who
            work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in,
            among other things, the provision of support services. By submitting
            your personal data, you consent to the transfer, storing or processing
            of such data outside the EEA. We will take all steps reasonably
            necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy.</span><span>
            3.4&nbsp;All
            information you provide to us may be stored on our servers or the
            servers of a third party in which case you consent to the transfer,
            storing or processing of such data by third parties which may be
            situated outside the EEA.</span><span>
            3.5&nbsp;Where
            you have been required to choose a password which enables you to access
            certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this
            password secure and confidential at all time in accordance with the
            Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</span><span>
            3.6&nbsp;The
            transmission of information via the internet is never completely
            secure. Although AB will do our best to protect your personal data and
            use industry standard procedures and security features to try to prevent
            any unauthorised access by a third party, we cannot guarantee the
            security of your data transmitted to our Site. You accept that
            transmission of your personal data is done at your own risk.</span>
            &nbsp;
            <h5>4. USING INFORMATION</h5>
            <span>
            Non-personally
            identifiable information may be shared with third parties to help us to

            experience or for other purposes, such as providing more relevant
            services and advertisements to users.</span><span>
            We
            may use your email address to contact you and send you notifications or

            you choose to display personal information such as comments, photos,
            videos, or other information to other users of the Site, you accept that
            you do so at your own risk. AB recommends that you do not share any
            personal contact information. You can review and change your privacy
            settings and personal profile, including who has access to your personal
            profile, at any time.</span><span>
            AB
            may at our sole discretion and without prior notice disclose users’
            personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are
            compelled to do so by any law, regulation or other government authority,
            in order to protect our rights and/or property or the rights and/or
            property of the general public. We may also co-operate with law
            enforcement agencies and where required, may disclose users’ personally
            identifiable information.</span>

            We
            may disclose your personal information to third parties if we acquire
            or dispose of any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your
            personal data to the prospective seller or purchaser of such business
            or assets; or if our assets or a substantial part of our assets are
            acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about
            our customers will be one of the transferred assets.&nbsp;</span>
            &nbsp;</p>
            <h5>6. LINKS</h5>
            <span>

            <span>
            Cookies
            are small files that contain information that is transferred to your
            computer, laptop or mobile media device's hard drive. They are used by
            many sites to provide features to their users. They help us to improve
            our Site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They
            enable us to log and quickly retrieve your login information and provide
            data to enable us to develop and improve the Site. We do not link the
            information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
            information provided by users. We also use persistent cookies which stay
            on your computer, laptop or mobile media device after you have gone
            offline. Persistent cookies can be found in your browser’s cookies
            folder and remain there after you have gone offline.&nbsp;</span><span>
            You
            may refuse to accept cookies by activating the settings on your browser
            which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. You can learn how to
            do this by accessing the ‘Help’ function on your browser. However, if
            you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of

            <span>
            9.1&nbsp;AB
            may use third-party advertising companies to target and display
            advertisements when you visit the Site. AB and its advertisers may also
            use third party advertising networks to help present and manage
            advertisements. These advertising networks may use general demographic
            information (although generally not including your name, address, email
            address or telephone number) about your visits to the Site to provide
            advertisements about product, goods and/or services that may be of
            interest to you. They may also use cookies, web beacons (electronic
            files that allow a website to count users who have visited that page or
            to access certain cookies) or similar mobile technologies to help
            present, target and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements,
            using data gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to
            determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their
            audience.</span><span>
            9.2&nbsp;Certain
            third party individuals or organisations may be granted access to your
            personal information (excluding your email address) as a result of
            agreements between AB and its affiliates and/or advertising partners.
            (However, if you provide your e-mail address and/or username directly to
            any such third parties, they may use your information for their own
            purposes.) Our partners may use such information for their own purposes,
            which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature and which
            may also include targeted advertising or direct marketing. These third
            parties may be based in the United Kingdom or abroad (including outside
            of the EEA).</span><span>
            9.3&nbsp;Certain
            third-party advertisements on the Site may provide you with opportunity
            to submit your username and/or other personal information within the
            advertisement in order to receive information or services provided by
            third parties. Such advertisements are provided by third parties and,
            the collection and use of the information submitted via such third party
            advertisements is subject to their privacy policies which may differ
            from our Privacy Policy. AB recommends you read the advertisers privacy
            policy before providing them with any personal information.</span><span>
            9.4&nbsp;We
            may also transfer statistical or generic trend information about use of
