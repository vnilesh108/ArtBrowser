*If the packaging was insufficient, please package to the best of your ability and be sure to take pictures for insurance purposes.</p>

  <p style="width:910px;height:60px; margin-left:220px;">All artworks sold on ArtBrowser are dispatched directly from the artist or gallery, and so packaging and services used will vary from piece to piece. As you would expect, it depends on size, weight, fragility of the artwork in question, not to mention where the buying client lives in relation to the artist or gallery. It might be down the road or on the other side of the world!</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">How can I cancel my order?</p>
<p style="width:910px;height:80px; margin-left:220px;">You are entitled to cancel your order at any point until the artwork is shipped, then you will have to wait until you receive it and put through a return request. Once the artist has confirmed the cancellation, you will be immediately refunded to your original payment mechanism. If you have not yet received a shipment confirmation, please contact us on shipping@artbrowserapp.com.
If you have received a shipment confirmation email. You will need to wait until receipt of the artwork, after which you can request a return under our 14 day, no risk policy.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">How do I request a return or a replacement?</p>

 <p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">If you are experiencing a significant delay in the arrival of an artwork, it is vital that you get in touch with us within 14 days of the estimated time of arrival.

Should your artwork not have arrived within 30 days of the estimated time of arrival stated on your shipment confirmation email, send us an email at shipping@artbrowserapp.com and we will be happy to process a full refund. </p>
<br><p  style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">Additional taxes can be applied if artworks are sent across country borders- these taxes are called customs duties and vary according to the countries involved and what is being shipped.
Couriers are obligated to pay customs for any taxes due when importing an item. They will keep hold of any item until those duties have been paid by the customer and this can result in delays to delivery as well as additional clearance charges levied by the courier.
In order for things to run smoothly, the sender needs to make sure that the correct paperwork is filled in for the courier to be able to pass through customs easily.
We encourage our artists to mark shipments 'Delivery Duty Paid', resulting in any customs charges being billed back to their own account, and to include this cost in their shipping calculations.  ArtBrowser can provide no guarantee against or compensation for costs incurred where this is not the case, so we strongly recommend you get in touch with the artist via the messaging service prior to dispatch to clarify arrangements should you have any concerns.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">When will my artwork be delivered?</p>

<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">All artworks sold on ArtBrowser are dispatched directly from the artist or gallery, so delivery times will vary from piece to piece.
If you have not yet received a dispatch email within 7 days from placing the order please contact us.
If you have received a dispatch email:
This email will contain details of the dispatch date and ETA
All artists are encouraged to use a tracked method of shipment and should provide tracking information in their profile area.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">How do I get updates about my Favourite Artists?</p>
<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">We want to make things as easy for you as possible! So once you let us know what you're interested in we do ALL the hard work!
If you 'Follow' your favourite artists, galleries or even your favourite other art lovers, and if you 'Like' your favourite artworks, then we will send you notifications as to the latest updates on them all!

<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Can I pay with any currency?</p>
<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">Currently we can only accept British Pound (GBP)</p> <br>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Currency Conversion</p>
<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">If you pay in a currency that’s different from the designated currency of your payment method, your provider or third-party payment processor may apply a currency conversion rate or fees to your payment. Please contact your provider (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) for information on what fees may apply, since these are not controlled by ArtBrowser.
</p><br>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Is my payment secure on ArtBrowser?</p>
<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">ArtBrowser’s system is designed to give you complete  peace of mind. Paying through ArtBrowser is vital to ensuring that your experience is as positive and secure as possible.

When you make a payment through ArtBrowser, funds go through our secure payment portal and are not released to the artist until our 14 day returns period has expired and the customer is satisfied with their purchase. By conducting your transactions on the site, you also have access to:
     - Our customer service team
     - The opportunity to review purchases and respond to reviews
     - An amazing community of like-minded artists and art-enthusiasts

Paying outside the ArtBrowser system is not secure, and we cannot provide access to our 14 day no risk returns policy when transactions occur outside the website. If your transaction happens off our platform and we have no record of it, it is will not be possible for us to assist you. </p>
<br> <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">How do I contact ArtBrowser?</p>

<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">PHOTO SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:
<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;">Photography guidelines for art lover customers
Email a photo with your review to submission@artbrowserapp.com</p>
<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;"  >Show us how your new artwork fits into your room and help inspire the ArtBrowser community. Art brings life and soul to our home and nobody can show this better than you. </p>
</p> <br>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">What are we looking for?</p>
<p style="width:910px;margin-left:220px;height:260px;">We’re looking for beautiful images of your new artwork in your home. Here are a few steps you can follow to make sure that you get it in its best light:
<br><br>
1. We want to see how the art is fitting into your life and your space. We’re not looking for close-ups of the art on a white wall, so please do include furniture or other objects that put the art into context. Ask yourself questions like: Is the new piece above your sofa? Or in your bathroom?Is that obvious from the photo?
<br><br>
2. Make sure that you take the photo during daylight hours, but not in such bright sunlight that strong shadows are created. Look out for
    yellow light from bulbs as they change or give the wrong impression of an artwork’s colour.
    <br><br>
3. Make sure that the artwork is clear in the pic. <br><br>
4. Try to make sure that the photo isn’t blurry or grainy. If you’re taking the photos on your phone, it’s always worth looking at them on your
    computer to check the quality on a larger screen. Ideally, send us a high resolution image (more than 1200 x 1200px) <br><br>
5. Make sure your photo is in the right file format (jpg or png) and has a maximum file size of 10Mb <br><br>

Please note any photographs you submit may be published on ArtBrowser and used for promotional purposes.</p>

All sellers on ArtBrowser are responsible for packaging-up and shipping artworks to their respective buyers.
<br></p> <br>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Getting Paid</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">There are no joining or listing fees for selling on ArtBrowser.

<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">It is 100% free to sign up and display your artworks on ArtBrowser. However we do charge commission on sales made through the ArtBrowser marketplace platform.</p>
<br><p  style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Commission</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">We deduct a 25% commission for artists and 15% for galleries and dealers every time an artwork is purchased through the site. This covers the cost of running the site and lets us promote further your work to more art lovers globally. </p>
<br><p  style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Processing fee</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">We ask all sellers to cover transaction processing fees of 3%. This surcharge is applied to the retail value of the item as set by you.</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">See examples below:</p>

  <span style="font-weight:bold">Net Amount Received by the Artists: £82</span></p><br>
  <p  style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Will I have to ship the artwork myself?</p>
  <p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">Yes, all artists and galleries on ArtBrowser are currently responsible for the fulfilment of orders themselves.
This means that, as a seller, you are required to pay for the initial outbound shipping on an artwork.
Customers are charged the full amount indicated in your shipping profiles, which are passed on to sellers (minus commission) when the order is paid out.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Is there an age limit?</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">Nope! As long as you're over 18 and know how to use a computer you can apply to sell through us.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;width:910px;">Can I sell my art collection or artworks on behalf of someone else?</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">ArtBrowser’s focus is on self-representing independent artists and galleries directly representing artist consignments. We do not provide a platform for those wanting to sell their art collection or to sell artworks of someone else (if you are not an official gallery for the artist)</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Can I sell from any country?</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px; width:910px;">You can sell your artworks from any location in the world! *Please note: you are responsible for adhering to the rules and regulations of your location with regards to shipping documentation and payment details.*
If we discover a listing or shop that doesn’t meet our guidelines, we may exercise our discretion to limit, suspend, deactivate, or cancel the seller's account. Take a look at our Terms of Service for more information and other requirements for listing your artworks on ArtBrowser.</p>
<p  style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">Unfortunately a number of applications to sell on ArtBrowser are unsuccessful, and too often it's not because of the quality of the art. Some of the most common reasons for unsuccessful applications are:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;"> - The artist description is left blank or simply states the obvious.<br>
 - The submitted artworks are badly photographed. Please read our guide on how to photograph your artwork.<br>
 - Great artworks are overshadowed by one or more works that are not as strong. We recommend making the art you submit show continuity of style,approach or content or all three. </p>
 <br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;width:910px;">What happens if an artwork is returned?</p>
 <p style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">ArtBrowser offers a FREE 14 day returns policy to all customers who are not 100% satisfied with their purchase.
We take care of the collection of your artwork from the customer, and will arrange for it to be delivered back to you.</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">We are currently unable to accommodate returns to Russia or the Ukraine so an alternative address will have to be provided.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;width:910px;">Does ArtBrowser have a print-on-demand service?</p>
<p  style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">In the occasion that a print is purchased, sellers on ArtBrowser are responsible for printing and shipping artworks to customers themselves. It is therefore a requirement that all artworks listed on the site are already printed and ready to ship to customers.</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;">ArtBrowser does not carry out any printing services on behalf sellers.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;width:910px;">How should I price my artworks?</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">Making art is about creative experiences that come from within; pricing art for sale is about what's happening in the outside world, where commodities are bought and sold, and where so many other factors dictate worth.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;width:910px;">Follow our basic pricing strategy to get started!</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">Basic pricing strategy:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">- Set an acceptable hourly rate <br>
- Multiply this by the hours spent creating an artwork <br>
- Adding costs for materials on top</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:910px;">For example, if you decided on an hourly rate of £15 and spent 25 hours creating your piece, the materials for which cost £100, your calculation would look like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;">- 25 hours x £15 hourly rate = £375 <br>
- Material costs = £100 <br>
- Artwork price = £375 + £100 = £475</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Consider the Market:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">Whilst it is of course important to price your artworks on their own merit, it is incredibly important to consider what's going on in the world of
art around you:
​<br><br>
- Consider the pricing of other artworks that are similar to yours by artists who have experienced similar professional success <br>
- Compare your art in terms of size, style, medium <br>
- Whilst it's easy to focus in on your area of the art market, don't make that focus too narrow - be aware of how others are pricing their artworks, even if they bear no resemblance to yours. Such knowledge as this is an indicator of the direction that the broader art market may be directed. <br>
- Think objectively about your art and where it lies in the grand scheme of things. But think objectively - perhaps invite somebody who knows your work,but isn't family, or your harshest critic for that matter. You are looking for an objective valuation. <br>
- You will often think of a price range for your artwork. As a general rule, price the work at the lower point you are considering rather than at the higher point.<br>
- Wherever possible keep your ArtBrowser price in line with your studio or gallery price. Consistency of pricing gives customers a sense of market worth and creates general reassurance around their purchase.<br>
- Make sure after our ArtBrowser commission, and other fees, you get an amount to hand that you are happy with.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Limited editions:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">Setting prices for editions is not much different to the strategy above:</p>
<p  style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">- Take the above basic pricing strategy and add value for additional considerations for the entire edition e.g. how much does it cost to produce an entire edition of 50 prints? And how many hours do you spend doing this? <br>
- Then divide this total by the number of editions to get a price per unit <br>
  Bear in mind that all editions should ideally sell out!</p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Other factors to consider:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">- Exhibiting success and other accomplishments in the art world <br>
- How long you have been selling for <br>
- Further costs, including commission charges and gallery guidelines, need also to be taken into account. <br>
- If you find yourself consistently selling the majority of your output over an extended period of time, you should consider upping your hourly rate, or
  applying a 10% increase to your existing prices. <br>
- Can you justify the price? Can you break it down and explain it to another person? If not, it might make sense to review your pricing</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">What are the image file requirements?</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">The ArtBrowser site requires the following minimum requirements for image uploads:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">All files must be in JPG and PNG format.
Images should be saved with an sRGB color profile to ensure correct color reproduction on the site.
Minimum required resolution is 1200px on the shortest side. This is to allow high quality display of your images on artwork pages without image degradation or upscaling. Our data has proven that buyers are much more likely to purchase an artwork that has high quality images. The required resolution also allows us to feature your artwork in our ArtBrowser Popup exhibitions that we're holding in cities around the world.</p>
<br><p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">What are the packaging and delivery guidelines?</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left:220px;font-weight:bold;">Prints</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Lower value prints can be shipped rolled in a tube:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">- Use a sturdy mailing tube over 2mm thick and a few inches longer than the width of your poster to avoid denting or damage in transit. Your mailing
  tube should not be so narrow that it requires rolling the print very tightly as this is likely to cause damage. <br>
- Place your print in the centre of a soft piece of paper around 30cm longer than the print lengthwise and equal to the inner length of your mailing tube
  widthwise, then place tissue paper just larger than the print on all sides on top of the print. <br>
- Fold the excess paper beneath the bottom of the print upward and press down so the bottom edge of the print is resting in the fold. <br>
- Gently roll the piece upwards to a diameter just smaller than that of your mailing tube. <br>
- Carefully insert the rolled print into the tube- the paper you have rolled the print in should fit snugly with the length of the tube to ensure a buffer
  preventing movement during shipping. <br>
- Top the tube with its end cap, and be sure to secure the caps on both ends with sturdy tape to ensure they do not come off during shipment.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Works on paper</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">We recommend sending higher-value prints and works on paper flat-packed:</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">- Wrap the work in acid free tissue paper. Plastic covering can be used for further protection against moisture.
<br>- Create corner protectors for each of the corners of your work: get a square piece of paper/acid free tissue paper, adjust the scale according to the size   of your work and fold it in half to create a triangle, then in half again.
<br>- Place these on each of the corners of your work, then tape the protectors to a sturdy piece of cardboard or foam core.
<br>- Place two or more pieces of firm cardboard on either side of the work and tape both sides together.
<br>- Fully wrap the piece in a thick layer of bubble wrap.
<br>- Surround the bubble wrap parcel with two pieces of corrugated cardboard to create an outer cover. Ensure that edges of both pieces are securely taped
  together with no gaps.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Canvas and framed works</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">- Find a box or build a crate with sufficient room to fit the work with 1-2 inches of space on each side.
<br>- Wrap the work in acid free tissue paper. Plastic covering can be used for further protection against moisture.
<br>- Wrap the piece in at least two layers of bubble wrap and secure with tape. Ensure that the corners of the piece are sufficiently padded to withstand
  damage on impact.
<br>- Place foam layers surrounding the piece and include additional packaging material to ensure a snug fit within the box, with no movement possible
<br>- We recommend that any particularly valuable, large or fragile pieces are shipped in a custom-made crate.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Delivery</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">- All artworks should be sent via a fully traceable and insured method of shipment
<br>- For artworks being shipped internationally, a service should be used which supports sending packages Delivery Duty Paid, and this option should be
  selected to ensure that all duty and import tax is billed back to the sender
<br>- All information declared in any accompanying paperwork should be complete and truthful, including the value and purpose of the shipment</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">ArtBrowser returns arrangements</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">- ArtBrowser will pay for and arrange the return of all artworks under ArtBrowser’s sitewide 14-day returns guarantee by customers who have changed
  their mind.
<br>- We ask for all artworks returned by customers to be prepared in their original packaging for the return journey and will accept no liability for damage
  sustained on the return leg by artworks not packed in line with these guidelines.
<br>- For editioned artworks subject to return requests, we reserve the right to offer replacement printing costs in lieu of arranging return shipment.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">How can I avoid returns?</p>
<p  style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">ArtBrowser is committed to helping buyers own affordable art that they love, as well as helping independent artists make a living from their craft. To this end, we offer all buyers a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"> free 14 day no risk money back guarantee </span>across all orders transacted through the site.
We understand how frustrating and disappointing it is to have your beloved artwork returned, and we feel that this figure can be improved.
<br> <br>We understand how frustrating and disappointing it is to have your beloved artwork returned, and we feel that this figure can be improved.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">So what can you do as a seller to lower your personal returns rate?</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">There are four options that a buyer must choose from when requesting a return: <br> <br>
1. The artwork arrived damaged <br>
2. The artwork was not as described in the listing <br>
3. I have changed my mind <br>
4. Other
<br><br>
With these options in mind, we recommend taking the following into consideration:</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Showcase your packaging...</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">Let's face it, it really doesn't matter how much fragile-tape you embellish your packages with; what happens to your artwork in transit is beyond your control!
​<br>
The first step is to showcase that you have packaging down to an art! Make use of secondary images and your 'Me at Work' images and videos to reassure the buyer that you pay care and attention to the dispatch of your artwork.
​</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">...and pack your works well</p>
<p  style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">The second step is to ensure that your artworks are well packed. You can mitigate damage by ensuring that both you and your artwork are adequately armed with sufficient packaging materials to ensure the safe transit to the customer. Not only that, if a customer decides that they do wish to send the artwork back, you can be reassured that it will be returned in packaging that you are happy with!</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">-  Can the package be bent? </p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">If dealing with prints, you may wish to consider rolling in a solid tube, or wrapping in bubble wrap and dispatching in a hard-backed envelope. With larger works, you may wish to consider sandwiching the artwork between two boards and shipping in a reinforced box.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">-  How are the corners? </p>
<p  style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">A lot of the damage that we see to artworks is a result of damage to the corners. Many artists elect to add polystyrene corner buffers to the artwork to protect against any bumps.
​</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">-  Is the artwork dry? </p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">It may sound obvious, but allow the artwork adequate drying time before packaging it up! Oils especially take longer than expected and may incur damage, even if they are transported and unpacked carefully.</p>
<p  style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Show your artwork in its best light</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">We've said it once and we'll say it again – there is nothing more important than ensuring accurate image reproduction in the images that you present on the ArtBrowser site. This is important for a customer to be able to envisage how the artwork will look, both in terms of scale and colour.
​<br>
If the colour on your screen doesn't correlate with that of the artwork that you see before you, don’t upload it to your shop. Think of it from a customer's perspective – you see an artwork that perfectly matches your décor in your home, but when it arrives the colours are less vibrant than expected...of course you would want to return it!
Similarly, the scale of your secondary images should accurately reflect the size of the artwork. If it appears bigger or smaller than in real terms, again, don't upload it to your shop!
​</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">Check your listings</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">Is the description accurate? Are the materials and quality exactly as described? Is it definitely an original, or are you selling a print? And are the dimensions correct? There are so many questions to ask yourself when creating a listings, but taking the time to make it accurate is important to ensure that no customer is misled into buying something that they were not expecting.
So before publishing a listing on ArtBrowser, consider all of the following factors to ensure that all of the information made available to the customer is as accurate as possible:
​<br>
<br>- Is the description representative of the work itself?
<br>- Did I definitely use those materials, tools and techniques?
<br>- Are the tags accurate and relevant to that artwork?
<br>- Are the dimensions correct?
<br>- Is the price accurate? Or perhaps you're unsure of how to price your artwork, in which case, check out <span style="text-decoration:underline;">our guide to pricing.</span>
<br> <br>
Any discrepancy in the above can result in an artwork being returned – so do what you can to avoid it and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">create the perfect listing!</span>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-left:220px;">And if worse comes to worst...</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;">As mentioned above, unfortunately there are extenuating reasons that may result in a return - whether the artwork is damaged in transit or a customer decides that they have changed their mind.
​<br> <br>
Part of ArtBrowser's free 14 day returns policy is that all returns are arranged and delivered back to you courtesy of us. </p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;"><strong>If it does come to this,</strong> then ensuring a smooth returns process could work in your favour and inspire confidence in your customer service and professionalism. You never know - the customer may remember that you made the best of a bad situation and return to purchase at a later date!</p>
<p style="margin-left:220px;width:930px;"><strong>-  Make sure</strong> that you return address is up to date on your Seller Portal - this is the address to which we will send the artwork. Perhaps you are on holiday or unable to collect the artwork? If you wish for it to be sent to another address for any reason, get in touch.
​<br> <br>
<strong>-  Ensure</strong> that all contact details are up to date - we will email you details of the return and may need to call you to arrange further details.
​<br> <br>
-  Take on board any comments that you receive from the customer - do take the customer's comments on board and see if you might be able to improve your service next time to ensure that the next sale goes through!
